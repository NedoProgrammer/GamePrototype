# GamePrototype
Welcome to the development branch of GamePrototype! This place is where the magic (and the pain) happens.

## Where is the stable build?
Currently, the game is not finished. You can check the `master` branch, but it's practically empty.

## So when will it be done?
I don't know. I'm making it alone (for now), so please do not expect it to come next week, or even next month ðŸ˜…. However, I am trying to keep track of the progress, so you can check out the Notion roadmap [here](https://nedo.notion.site/783fb1e6bbbd4633ae071e1915495a4a?v=1cc580b9c2c5491c810ad22f6d762f6e).

## I want to build the game myself!
Well, you will need a Windows machine, MinGW and CMake installed. Then, you can:

- Clone the repo: `https://github.com/NedoProgrammer/GamePrototype`
- Download and extract FFMPEG from [here](https://github.com/GyanD/codexffmpeg/releases/tag/4.3.1-2020-11-19) (specifically the `full_build-shared` archive)
    - Rename the extracted folder to `ffmpeg`
- Run `cmake .` and `cmake --build .`
- Enjoy!

## ...Contributing?
Of course! My C++ code isn't the best, so if you wish to fix/test something, feel free to create an issue or a PR! ðŸ™‚
